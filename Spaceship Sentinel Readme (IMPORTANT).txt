Hello!

First of all, thank you for downloading this beautiful game created by the Crossover team!
Secondly, thank you for opening this readme file.

The mothership has crashed and You, the player(s) are the only survivors left. In order to escape, the mothership must fix itself but sadly it does take some time to do so.

In this game, You must defend mothership for 10 minutes while it is repairing itself. The monsters, which not only appear every 20 seconds, but also spawn when you start the game, will use ranged attacks to kill you.

The default controls (which are configurable in the Settings menu) are:
- WASD or Arrow keys for movement
- Mouse for aiming, Left click for shooting
- 1 for deselecting weapon, 2 for quick switching to a weapon
- 3 for using healing item, 4 for using turret item
- Tab for opening inventory

There are also additional buttons for debugging purposes but consider them as easter eggs :)

In order to beat this game, you must not let the mothership be destroyed or be left without any alive players.
To do this, there are multiple mechanics to help you:
1. Trading system. You can access it by pressing Tab near the mothership or the wandering trader
2. Crafting system. While having open inventory, press Q to open crafting menu
3. Resources, which are used in the crafting recipies
4. Turrets - fairly cheap and really powerful
5. Bot players - fairly expensive and not that powerful, but quite cool nonetheless

...and more, but it's all for you to find.

There is also a fairly hidden setting, be the first to find it!

Try this game, learn how different enemies behave, find the best strategy for you, but most importantly,
Have fun!
